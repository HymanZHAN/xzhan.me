**Hello and welcome to my blog!**

I am very excited to start my own blog, as this could be a great learning experience for myself but also provide potential help to others. I am also likely to sync my publication to my [dev.to](https://dev.to/hymanzhan) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@zhanxucong).

This blog will mainly consist of learning notes and thoughts about technologies I am interested in:

- Python, Django & ASGI frameworks
- C#, Rust & Go
- JS/TS, Angular, Vue & NestJS
- Linux & Fedora
- Docker & OpenShift
- VS Code & Vim

Some content already in the pipeline include:

- Building a project in FastAPI with clean architecture
- How to effectively test a FastAPI application

I aim to become a well-rounded full-stack architect and hopefully this blog can help along the way.

**Again, thanks for stopping by!**
