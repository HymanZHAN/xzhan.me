summary: "Recently, the majority of my work involves integrating Vue in a traditional Django application, which uses jQuery extensively. The first task on this front is to convert a preview modal into a Vue component and add some quick editing functionality. In this post, I will share some refactoring experience and lessons learned along the way."
